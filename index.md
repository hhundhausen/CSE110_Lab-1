## Welcome 
Hello👋 , my name is **Helena Hundhausen**; welcome to my user page! I am a second-year undergraduate student at the *University of California, San Diego* studying computer science. This page has been created to provide insight into who I am as a programmer and as a person. 

 ``` 
 public class welcome {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    system.out.println("Welcome Viewer!); 
  }
 }
 ```

## Personal Background 
I was born and rasied in *Honolulu, Hawaii*, until seventh grade my parents and I moved to *San Diego, California* to be closer to family. I love *San Diego*, because of its beaches, food, and neighboring cities. 

In my free time, I love to spend time with my parents, drink iced-coffee, hike with my dog, and read.

I am a **huge** coffee drinker. I enjoy the taste of coffeee as much as the caffine it provides. I have tried a lot of local San Diego Coffee Shops, and my ulitmate favorite is a shop called [Lofty Coffee Company](https://loftycoffee.com/pages/encinitas). I like Lofty Coffee Company, because they make the best [crossiants](https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/croissant) and [iced lattes](https://www.istockphoto.com/search/2/image?phrase=iced%20latte). 

During Summer 2022, I grew a huge obession with reading and read *thirty* books (admittedly all were fiction). Written below is a quote from one of my favorite books that I read over that particular summer titled *Ignite Me* by Tahereh Mafi. 
> "Books are easily destroyed. But words will live as long as people can remember them." - from Ignite Me by Tahereh Mafi  

## Programming Background 
In high school, I took computer science courses at a local community college in San Diego called *MiraCosta*. I really enjoyed learning the concepts and atmosphere in my computer science courses, which lead me to want to pursue it as a career. Since then, I have grown a passion for math, embedded systems, and software engienering. 

I have gained experiences in the programming languages: 
* Java 
* Python 
* C 
* C++ 
* ARM Assembly 

I have gaind experiences in the technical tools: 
* Replit 
* VSCode 
* GitHub 
* MatLab
* LaTeX
