## Introduction 
Hello, my name is Helena! I am from Honolulu, Hawaii, and moved to San Diego, California in seventh grade to be closer to my extended family. I started my coding journey in high school by attending computer science courses at a community college called MiraCosta. Since then, I have grown a passion for math, embedded systems, and software engineering.
